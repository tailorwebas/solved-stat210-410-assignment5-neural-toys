<h1>Question 2</h1>

The <em>Toy </em>data-set is a simulated data-set that contains a response variable, <em>Y </em>, along with nine predictor variables. The following tasks require you to use the <em>neuralnet </em>package in <strong>R</strong>. Use a 75:25 train:test split for parts (a) and (b). Use a set.seed value of 430 for all questions.

<ul>

 <li>Train a neural network with only one hidden unit to predict the response variable using all predictor variables. Produce a graph of your trained neural network. Provide an overview of your analysis and results, including the correlation coefficient of actual and predicted Y in the data-set.</li>

 <li>Train 7 neural networks, each time adding one extra hidden node. Produce a summary graph of the correlation coefficient of each network vs the number of hidden units. Provide an overview of your analysis and results.</li>

 <li>Train 4 neural networks with differing training and testing splits as follows: [20% training; 80% testing], [40% training; 60% testing],[60% training; 40% testing], [80% training; 20% testing]. Produce a summary graph of the correlation coefficient of each network vs the percentage of training set data used. Provide an overview of your analysis and results.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Hint: </strong>for parts (b) and (c) use a <em>for loop </em>in your code to automate the process
